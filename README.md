# AlgorithmOrderReadMachine
Create an algorithm to read order and output cook sequence.


Algorithm project. Given the conditions of Create an algorithm to read fish & chips orders and output the sequence to put the ingredients. 

Conditions:
We got 4 Fish Fryers, 4 Chips Fryers.  

The cooking time: 
 1. Cod - 80secs to cook 
 2. Haddock - 90secs to cook 
 3. Chips - 120secs to cook  
 
 
Design an algorithm to read input of orders & output the best sequence for putting ingredients.
